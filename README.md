# Quick, Draw Doodle Recognition

This is the source code for my solution to the [Google Quick, Draw! Doodle Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quickdraw-doodle-recognition).

### Overview 

The challenge is an image classification problem that ran from September to December 2018. Quick, Draw was a game released by google to educate the public about how AI works. It prompted users to draw an image depicting certain categories such as "banana" or "table". The data for the challenge consisted of 50M drawings from the game. Solutions from the competition had far reaching impact on pattern recognition fields including [Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition), [Automatic Speech Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition#End-to-end_automatic_speech_recognition), and [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).
